# AppiumLibrary Examples

## Intro

This project consists in Robot Framework and AppiumLibrary test suites. The `Appium_demo.robot` was created to test the proposed keyword, **Swipe Path** [branch swipe_path](https://github.com/HelioGuilherme66/robotframework-appiumlibrary/blob/3a076dfcb7336a466ff8a2ac63ed37bfea90b8f8/AppiumLibrary/keywords/_touch.py#L128).

The directory `mydrawingapp` contains a basic cross-platform app, created with [beeware.org](https://beeware.org/). An Android 12 app was build to use with the test, [here is a screen capture](./mydrawingapp/src/mydrawingapp/resources/android12_emulator.png). You can install [app-debug.apk](https://transformidea.com/mydrawingapp/app-debug.apk) in Android 12 or higher.
